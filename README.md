# conceptNet-el
ConceptNet-el version 2.1.0 (last update: 2025-07-08) is a computational lexicon of Modern Greek that is conceptually organised as a linguistic ontology. It currently comprises c.34K tokens (i.e. unique instances of meaning and form combination). Both single- and multi-word entries are included in the lexicon. These are specified for (a) features pertaining to lexical-semantic relations (i.e, synonymy, antonymy); (b) lexical relations such as word families, allomorphs, syntactic variants, etc.; (c) morphosyntactic properties (PoS, gender, declension, argument structure, word-specific information, etc.), and (d) morphosemantic relations. Properties of lexical entries have been encoded as attribute-value pairs. The work has received funding from two national projects, namely POLYTROPON (KRIPIS-GSRT, MIS: 448306) and DRASIS projects; it has also received internal funds from ILSP.  The lexicon is being extended and enriched.
